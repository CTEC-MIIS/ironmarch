<br />
The next option, &quot;Find &lt;strong&gt;author&lt;/strong&gt;&quot; can be used to only find content from a specific user. As you begin typing ausername, you should see a dropdown with username suggestions that you can select from.<br />

<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Inline Search&lt;/strong&gt;<br />

<br />
&lt;strong&gt;Results&lt;/strong&gt;<br />
Once you have submitted your search, a tabbed page of results will appear - you can change the selected tab to choose which area of the community you wish to search. For example, results under the &quot;Forums&quot; tab will bring up any topics and posts that contain your search keywords, while the &quot;Members&quot; tab will bring up any member accounts that match your search criteria.<br />
<br />
You can change the order of the results to sort by relevance or to sort by date using the options at the top of the results page.<br />
<br />
The keywords that you searched for will be highlighted like &lt;span class=&#39;searchlite&#39;&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.<br />

<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	When visiting the board, you will be presented with a list of categories and forums in those categories. This page is called the Board Index, and it lists all of the forums.</p>
<p>
	<br />
	Forums are split into categories. You can choose to hide any category by pressing the &quot;-&quot; button on the right-hand side above the list of forums, and the &quot;+&quot; button to make them visible again. If hidden, such categories, and the forums inside them, will be collapsed and no longer shown to you when visiting the board index.<br />
	<br />
	When viewing the forums, there are icons shown next to them which indicate the status of a forum, and if it has unread posts or not.</p>
<p>
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/f_icon.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that there are posts which you have not read contained inside this forum, or one of it&#39;s sub forums.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/f_icon_read.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that all of the posts contained in this forum and it&#39;s sub forums have been read.<br />

	<br />
	<br />
	<em><strong>The Topic List</strong></em><br />
	Within each forum there are a list of topics. Just like forums, each topic has an marker to indicate the type of topic it is:<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_unread.png&#39; /&gt; A regular topic with unread posts.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_read_dot.png&#39; /&gt; This is a topic which you have participated in, with no new replies since you last read it.<br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_unread_dot.png&#39; /&gt; This indicates that you have previously replied in this topic, and there are new replies since you last read or replied to the topic.</p>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Special Types of Topics</strong></em><br />
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_announcement.png&#39; /&gt; This icon indicates an &quot;Announcement&quot; - Announements are not regular topics, because members cannot reply to them. They are simply important news or information which should be read.</p>
<p>
	<span class=""ipsBadge ipsBadge_orange"">Hot</span> This icon indicates a hot topic which has many members participating and replying.</p>
<p>
	&lt;img src=&#39;{style_image_url}/t_moved.png&#39; /&gt; Topic that has been moved into another forum.<br />

	<em><strong>Sorting Options</strong></em><br />

	&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Show type - this allows you to only display certain types of topics such as polls or topics that you have posted in.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort by - this allows you to change the way topics are ordered. By default topics are ordered with the topics that have most recently had replies first, but you can choose to sort by other factors such as the number of replies or alphabetically.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Sort direction - this allows you to set which way you want to sort for the setting above. For example if you set &quot;Sort by&quot; to be &quot;Replies&quot;, choosing &quot;A-Z&quot; for this setting will show the topics that have no replies first, whereas choosing &quot;Z-A&quot; will show the topics with the most replies first.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Time frame - this allows you to limit the topics that are shown to only topics that have been made within a certain amount of time.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;<br />
