	&gt;Implying we'd ever let a nigger be mod on IM. <img alt="":lol:"" data-emoticon="""" src=""<fileStore.core_Emoticons>/emoticons/lol.png"" title="":lol:"" /></p>

	We don't just ban people based on race or views as we don't limit potential for keks that can be had and the restrictions that we have don't allow for anything negative to actually grow out of it. Frankly, didn't believe it was an actual black, we have a history of trell accounts, like one started by one of our own moderators - ""the fascist jew"".

	Your post has no dox info. If you're worried that your username is linked to other stuff, you have the power to change your own username to something else. That should be a much better fix.

	We don't ""take down"" posts. I mean, you can always edit it to replace it with a period, I guess.

	Why do you even care? You're writing under a pseudonym. Nobody will know who you are. It's not like IM is going to forward your IP adress to britzog. If they ask, we're just going to laugh at them. relax.

	Zero reason to remove anything here, you had a meetup before the ban, no legal action is possible. And <abbr title=""National Action"">NA</abbr> getting banned isn't going to stop anything so at most this will look cowardly, and you're under a pseudonym like Zeiger said. No reason at all to be worried.
