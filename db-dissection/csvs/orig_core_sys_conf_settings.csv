<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">III. <span style=""color: rgb(255,140,0)"">Community</span></strong><br />
<br />
Iron March is not a movement, but we expect users to share our purpose â€“ to take an active interest in using the forum, and when contributing to do so as fascists in ultimate pursuit of knowledge, ideas, contacts, etcetera. Those who are not constructive and threaten this are in the wrong place and unwelcome. We recognize there is a widespread character issue in movement politics, and we start here to address some of those problems here. The following rules are to be observed by all members and handled quickly and diplomatically where possible.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1. </strong>No â€˜Spergingâ€™. As in â€˜Aspergerâ€™s syndromeâ€™, an Autistic mental disorder characterized by extreme egocentricity and an inability to understand how to interact socially. This policy is to curtail and recognize the tendencies of users whose actions and motivations are outside our common goals, are deliberately of no benefit to anyone, and only serve to cause trouble. Regardless of whether it is motivated by narcissism, social alienation, cowardice, or stupidity we must control it, and it is the userâ€™s responsibility to observe these following principles which will serve as a guide to ensure there will be no problems for you while you are here.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.1 - </strong>Role-playing. The tendency to portray personal views in the third person with no clear relation to the real world constitutes a form of role-playing. Another form of role-playing is found in arrogance; insisting on special treatment or to be regarded as a separate tier, in contradiction to the fact it is usually marked by an absence of; personal effort, courage, commitment, consistency, positions that will attract negative response, interest in people, etc - by coincidence. If you are a fake you will be recognized and publicly called out.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.2 - </strong>Fashion Fascism. Fascism isn't a fetish â€“ if you regularly treat it as such your motivations will be questioned as ulterior. If you reflect your political â€˜identityâ€™ in things like science fiction or anything else found in Television, Video games, hobbies, sub-cultures etc, it tells us that you are unable to distinguish between the two.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.3 - </strong>Shitposting. Making shit posts; this happens when a post is devoid of content or context, eg randomly responding with a reaction image. If you have nothing else to contribute you have no right to be engaging in this.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.4 - </strong>Constructive debate. The goal of debate is the pursuit of truth therefore you should take care about what you are saying and care about opposing arguments and should assume it is the same for your opponent â€“ so where relevant you should be capable of providing sources to back up an opinion - this is an argument. Ignoring responses while continuing to argue shows you have no investment in the discussion and also, that you have nothing to offer or contribute.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.5 - </strong>Conduct. It is your responsibility to judge group relations and know what not to post and where things should be posted. When you can participate in a forum drama, promote yourself, become insolent towards members, etc, is something only you can judge.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">If these are not monitored by the user and kept in check it may result in messages of warning from moderators.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">2.</strong> This is not <em class=""bbc"">Stormfront</em>. Our community is based on discussion and debate constructive towards fascist goals<em class=""bbc"">, it is not a hangout for White Nationalists and their unique subculture. Stormfront </em>and <em class=""bbc"">VNN </em>forums already provide this in terms of its endless topics on conspiracy theories, chimpouts, Zionism, etcetera. Exclusively posting remarks and threads of that nature without proper context is a form of spamming<em class=""bbc"">.</em></span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color: rgb(188,188,188)""><span style=""font-family: tahoma""><span style=""font-size: 12px;""><span style=""background-color: rgb(26,26,26)"">Likewise, we are not a <em class=""bbc"">New Right</em> intellectual circle jerk and we do not tolerate aimless, abstract philosophizing and the typical self-important snobbish behavior that comes with it. Furthermore we recognize displays of such behavior to be a form of violation of points outlined in segment <strong class=""bbc"">III </strong>of this charter (<strong class=""bbc"">Community</strong>).</span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style=""color: rgb(188,188,188)""><span style=""font-family: tahoma""><span style=""font-size: 12px;""><span style=""background-color: rgb(26,26,26)""><strong class=""bbc"">3.</strong> Tolerance. We accept people with strong viewpoints even if ultimately we seek everyone to join us in our comprehension of the world, whilst also understanding that this can be accomplished only so far via our internet forum platform. Those who take themselves too seriously yet refuse to debate become paranoid, patronizing, passive aggressive and can become the source of drama. Users of non straight-white-male-fascist backgrounds also need to be conscious of their differences and check their privilege at the door. If you have allowed yourself to become aggravated through your own fault we will not side with you and you may be held responsible.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">4.</strong> Sophian Language. You are expected to use this website with intelligence, knowing not what to write and to read between the lines. Nobody is likely to monitor the website or trawl through your messages, but by posting here you need to personally be prepared it might be read in a court, quoted on in a newspaper, or read to your weeping mother â€“ and hold yourself to account. Don't ask us to delete all your posts because you have ""changed your mind."", or even attempt to alter them yourself. Remember you public posts are cached by search engines or may be recorded by others.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">5.</strong> Untermenschen. Just being you can result in an immediate ban, and we will take immediate and permanent action if it is ever found out the following applies to you.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">5.1</strong> - We do not allow or entertain the mentally ill to the extent they cannot understand fascism, (for instance those who do genuinely suffer from Autism) and it is our responsibility to direct them away from this place because they should not be here.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">5.2</strong> - Expression of interest in Paedophilia (Including any similar inclinations towards the under-aged) will result immediate ban, and even the slightest hint will be treated seriously.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">5.3</strong> - Simply put, we reserve the right to ban you if you are any kind of faggot. If you feel the need to tell the world then you will bring the consequences on yourself just as hard. Belonging to the furry fandom is prohibited, partly because it also involves a breach of 1.1 and 1.2, but mostly because it is utterly degenerative (it deserves note here because it will apply even if explicitly sexual grounds cannot be ascertained).<br />
<br />
Failure to comply may result in <em class=""bbc"">internment</em>, when a member's activity on the forum is restricted to the Showers. These members will be marked as <strong class=""bbc"">Prisoners </strong>and they will inevitably be <strong class=""bbc"">Gassed</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">IV. <span style=""color: rgb(255,140,0)"">Forum Activities</span></strong><br />
<br />
Iron March Forum provides it's users with a number of activities that help us develop as a forum, an information center and a community for fellow fascists as well as establish new projects outside the Forum both online and in real life. Any user can officially sign up for any such activity and become an active contributor. Simply follow the rules of each such activity and you will find yourself occupied with interesting projects that will help you develop your skills or further your knowledge.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">V. <span style=""color: rgb(255,140,0)"">Discipline</span></strong><br />
<br />
We expect every user to follow the rules set forth by the Adminship.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.</strong> Our community is interested in active members, not lurker and defunct profiles. All accounts that have <em class=""bbc"">zero</em> posts for a week after registry on the forum will be deleted. Once a year (sometime in January) the forum undergoes cleaning of defunct profiles, meaning that any years old profiles with less than 10 posts are permanently deleted. The more the forum membership grows with active users the higher the number of posts required to prevent deletion will become.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">2.</strong> Before creating a new topic make sure that a similar one doesn't already exist and be sure to post topics in the appropriate sections of the Iron March forum. Use the search bar in the top right corner if you are not sure where to look.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">3.</strong> Do not derail topics, do not flame, do not spam (outside <a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/forum/78-cancer/"">Cancer</a> and the <a class=""bbc_url"" href=""http://ironmarch.org/index.php?/forum/13-wastelands/"">Wastelands</a>).<br />
<br />
<em class=""bbc"">*It is the userâ€™s responsibility not to be trolled.</em><br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">4.</strong> Follow the respective rules of all forum activities and projects as they are explained in the sections dedicated to those activities.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">5.</strong> Moderators and Admins may dispense punishment at their discretion and can give formal warnings to users who behave in an unacceptable manner (unnecessary aggression, blatant and systematic disregard of the forum rules and etc) with 3 and more warnings being grounds for temporary suspension or immediate gassing, or in some cases said penalties can happen with no warning at all.<br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">VI. <span style=""color: rgb(255,140,0)"">Uniform</span></strong><br />
<br />
<strong class=""bbc"">1.</strong> Forum avatars are restricted to a size of 150x200 pixels, and 25 kb.</span></span></span></span><br />
