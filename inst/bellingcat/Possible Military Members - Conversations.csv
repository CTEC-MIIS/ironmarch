 Whats up Devil. I got my UH Contract so now I have that guarunteed 0300 slot. Hopefully I'll be in Lejeune by next year after ITB. Stick around so I can have some Fascist friends on base haha.

 Foreal, boot camp and ITB are gonna be the easiest parts of the Marines, not gonna lie. The hikes aren't too bad, the worst one for me was the 20k and that's bc it was raining nonstop and we were the last platoon. My feet were destroyed and we had mout town right after that. The Crucible isn't that bad honestly, it sucks while you're in the middle of it but that's everything. You're gonna have a couple hell days with your DI's which will be worse. The hard part is gonna be getting to your unit and not having someone tell you what to do or not do. Work your ass off now getting ready for it and suffer less while you're there.

 Also as a general question for ideologies among most Marines, how many of your compatriots would you consider to be Right-Wing or Fascist? I know there are a lot of spics in the Corps now, but have you managed to find anybody else with our views?

 Yes, surprisingly enough, most of the guys I've listened to on podcasts and such that are former or currently in the military are Marines. One is even a Major. In my unit, there's another guy who could'v easily been a grand wizard Inn the local Klan. He's very fascist, way before I even considered it. You'll probably find the most anti establishment and hard right guyside in the Marines. In my experience anyways. The only catch up you might find is the race question, but depending on who they are personally they're probably already privy to it. For most Marines however, we're all green underneath.

 I have a lot of Fascist friends in the Army. They say there are a lot of ""Red-pilled"" Soldiers due to the fact that major bases like Fort Bragg are infested with Niggers. Also what unit are you attached to? I know Lt Col. Liston in 2nd LAR based in Lejeune. That guy gave me a lot of advice before I joined.

 Damn. Lots of guys in the military become red pilled. Seeing first hand how little the government actually takes care of its fighting force, much less it's citizens is more than enough for many. And if that's not enough, killing some sand niggers does the rest. There's a catch 22 though. Some come out of it for some reason, utterly blue pilled. I'm with 3/23.

 Bruh lol I was supposed to be going Helmad but instead our unit got dropped from it even though we were the best in the battalion. My only problem with fuckin with Iran is what Russias take on it. I didn't not vote for Hillary just to see us back at odds with Russia again. Like I said, I got no problem shootin some Dune jockies but if that's just gonna cause more tensions with Putin it's probably best not to. I joined with the same reasoning. I may or may not look into pmc work after my enlistment, who knows, but at some point I plan on shooting towards a public office seat.

 That's actually really interesting. After my active duty I plan on either creating a Paramilitary or doing PMC work as well. I've considered the French Foreign Legion if I'm still up for it in the end. Why did you pick Reserves? Have you picked up rank quickly? I hear Reservists get promoted fast. Whats your current rank?

 Lol reservists pick up rank fast he says. No, I JUST got lcpl. I've been in for 2 years and just fucking got it. I've got active cats I graduated boot camp and ITB with that are already Cpl. And contrary to popular belief, our unit kicked ass at 29 stumps. The coyotes said we out performed lots of active companies they've seen in the past. If I go pmc after enlistment I might go down to Mobile, there's a guy there that only hires Marine grunts. He hires out for naval guarding so shit like Captain Phillips doesn't happen again.

 Haha congrats Lance Coolie. Have you considered Academi (Blackwater)? I'm not too sure what they're up to these days but that's typically what most guys go for. Honestly the volatile conflicts these days seem too boring for me. I was considering Ukraine or Syria but both wars are bullshit. Nothing really worth backing over there.

,22418,5127,1486681760,"<p>
 I considered Syria as well but all you'd be doing is helping Muslims fight Muslims. The Ukrainian conflict is edgy simply bc I'm not a fan of whites vs whites. But they're picking back up from what I hear. Romania may be another stomping ground. They're peacefully ousting their parliament there but who knows what that can turn into once NATO gets their fingers in it. There's a lot of unknowns, especially in what can happen in 4 years time.

,6413,1760,1372440143,"<p>Yes, but it depends on where you are in the service. I can only tell about my experience in the Army, you'd have to hit up the Marines and Navy guys for their input. The Army can be divided between two kinds of jobs: non-combat and combat. Non-combat jobs typically have units that are the least disciplined, the least motivated, and the least competent. Non-combat units also tolerate less horseplay and less ""shit talk,"" which makes non-PC misogynistic and/or racist jokes a serious issue. They also happen to be units with the largest percentage of non-Whites (another reason why political correctness is an issue). I've seen units of mechanics, of admin, even of communications that were majority non-White. Combat units on the other hand, are overwhelmingly White. While the Army itself might be 70-75% White, combat units - especially Infantry- tend to be upwards of 85-95% percent White, depending on where you classify Caucasoid Hispanics. These units are the complete opposite of what I described above. They're one of the last places in our system of government where it is still acceptable to publicly be as sexist, racist, and discriminatory as you want (so long as a non-combat officer doesn't hear you!). It's not a wonder that an institution like that attracts its fair share of fascists, nationalists, and far-right conservatives (like preppers, militia, etc.).</p>
 <p>In my unit (infantry) I've met quite a few rightists - some openly NS, lots of neo-Nazis, others just nationalists, others red-pilled conservatives, others blue-pilled militiamen, even a couple Mormon extremists. You see plenty ""of our kind"" in the combat arms. But you have to be careful about it, Military Police are always watching and always eager to enforce the ban on extremist activity by military personnel. A good way people in the military find other rightists is to simply wear a shirt with some obscure fascist logo. I met my good buddy at a brigade luncheon when he noticed the Totenkopf on my shirt. On most bases you can see the occasional right-wing symbol. Sun wheel there, 88 here, Mussolini's face over there, a Templar cross tattoo. The symbols of SS units are especially common, even on things as public as cars, flags, and helmets.</p>
 <p>What I'm trying to get across here is that, yes, there are lots of fascists in the military. But only in some parts and almost always in secret. It's extremely dangerous to be openly political. Even two hardcore NS might be worried about speaking politics amongst themselves. When my company commander mentions that ""this country needs a beer hall putsch and some brownshirts"", I know this is something he would not say in front of his superiors, even if his superiors have said similar things.</p>",3af532e833437f91490ee6505c59f3dd,130,184.152.41.168,0

 <p>I'd prefer something in the Mid-Atlantic Region, but may have to pick something closer in New York (the State not City).</p>
 <p>I've tended to do well in areas of History and Literature, Philosopy all that stuff, Military History as well but from this damned internet search engine the only school that sems to have all these things are West Point which im not qualified to enter, hence why I decided on ROTC in the first place.</p>
 <p> But I understand it would be a good idea to try and become educated in some hands on skill.</p>
 <p>Machine tooling seems interesting, perhaps Gunsmithing?</p>

,6418,1761,1372511099,"<p>Hmm I do not have great knowledge of schools in NY, but here are some suggestions in the general area you mentioned:</p>
 <p>Norwich University (in Vermont but it's a military university with ROTC/NROTC and has military history/strategic studies majors). Well-respected in the military as far as I have heard.</p>
 <p><strong>PA:</strong></p>
 <p>Penn State </p>
 <p>Temple University</p>
 <p>UPIttsburgh</p>
 <p><strong>WV:</strong></p>
 <p>WVU (fairly conservative but it is overall a party school. Only has Army ROTC).</p>
 <p><strong>MD:</strong></p>
 <p>UMD - College Park (Great ROTC program and is basically a public Ivy)</p>
 <p>Towson University</p>
 <p><strong>D.C.: (Keep in mind these ones are extremely expensive without an ROTC scholarship, which is not guaranteed)</strong></p>
 <p>American University</p>
 <p>Catholic University</p>
 <p>VA:</p>
 <p>GMU (only Army ROTC but fairly conservative campus with decent international politics programs/distinguished teachers)</p>
 <p>UVA (has all ROTC units but extremely left-wing culture).</p>
 <p>Virginia Tech (this one is an outlier for the range you noted, but probably the best cadet program on the eastern seaboard apart from Annapolis).</p>
 <p>VMI (some of my friends go here; excellent military school).</p>
 <p>Can't say I know much about Delaware apart from the U of, which I've not heard much good/bad about. Just remember that if you take ROTC your military science courses are going to include military history, and you can place them in tandem with a history major/minor. </p>
 <p>As far as the practical skills aspect, I don't know of most schools offering them in ROTC programs. Usually you have to enlist to get that sort of training, or take classes at a vocational school. The most practical majors are generally considered to be finance/accounting or anything in engineering. In my case I chose neither, so time will tell if I get a job.</p>",56d94d2bdc6a9987c219cc85a94c4550,6122,76.104.26.181,0

 <p>Anyways, I don't know if you're looking for contributors to Reaktion right now, but if you are, I'm interested. I have a professional background in illustration and would gladly provide some black and white propaganda if you're interested in it, since I've been sketching up some designs I plan on making fliers to distribute around my home city. Unfortunately being forward deployed right now makes getting scans of the art difficult, so I might not be able to pitch stuff like that until I get back in June.</p>

I'll think of what content I'm looking for, write now the next issue will talk about lot more about the Fascist worldview and alienation and I may draw on James Mason and CIV Collapse for inspiration. Tell me what your interests are as far as subjects is concerned and we'll come up with something.</p>",98f01b6cedcfadbc5b2966ea1ce3fd1c,35,50.151.185.150,0
,5884,1626,1365351554,"<p>Cool. And I'm quite fine with you moving away from the imperialist flavor of things with Reaktion. Prior to getting into Fascism I used to consider myself an American Imperialist, in the Theodore Roosevelt sense of it... Though I realized it was useless when the values of today's empire conflicted wildly with my own, and were all about globalism, capitalism, and liberalism. Even our military conquests, something often accused of Fascism, generally end up in being liberal-democracy clusterfucks fraught with corporate contracting scandals. That, and what kind of lifestyle would an ""American Imperialist"" have, when today's American values are completely confused and degenerate?</p>
 <p>It was too much of a fantasy, and a lonely one at that, whereas Fascism, even if it didn't result in political change in the US, at least offered ideals to live by as a man even without a Fascist movement or state to march with. Which in a way, I think is how an American Fascist/Futurist is destined to be for now, kind of in the Old West tradition where the most daring men tended to strike out into Indian country to carve a living for themselves, their family, or their little clan. At the risk of sounding a little too Evolish, living as a Fascist man in the absence of a Fascist state is a worthy pursuit to me, while still doing your part to network with likeminded people.</p>
 <p>So, that's one subject that interests me; exploring how the traditionally American idea of a Free Man is compatible with Fascism. ""American Freedom"" to me, rather than meaning ""<em>I'm free to marry my poly triad fuckbuddies and have the state pay for my sex-change</em>"", traditionally conjures up ideas of the wilderness-mastering pioneer, the rough &amp; tumble cowboy, Harleys with POW/MIA flags and riders with holstered pistols roaring across desert highways... Myth and icons that are inherently rebellious in the face of nanny-state pussy authority, championing bellicose masculine virtues that I see as being not only compatible with an American variant of Fascism, but absolutely ideal for it... Especially with Futurism thrown in there. Mind you, I come to Fascism as a military artist, so I do tend to see things in a subcultural light before I really have much interest in sitting down to write up a detailed plan with flowcharts on how I'd want to run a Fascist economy, when I'm more immediately concerned with letting the current one collapse. I suppose I'd make a better Squadrista than a statesman, in that sense. Like the famous commie-killer Chesty Puller said, ""<em>I want to go where the guns are""</em>.</p>
 <p>Anyway, as far as what I plan to do with the artwork, what I have in mind is to make some militant anti-globalist, anti-materialist, anti-bourgeois, anti-capitalism posters which, at a quick/uneducated glance, would seem at home next to announcements for Anarchist demonstrations, SlutWalks, local hipster band events and such on your typical liberal art college's announcement board or coffee shop 'zine rack. But instead of it being the usual punk or Anarchist smashing icons of greed, it'd be more soldierly archetypes that convey a sense of duty and martial spirit, rather than heroizing some pansexual libertine in a hoodie and bandana.</p>
 <p>You already had a few things in Reaktion that were in the general realm of what I'm pursuing, such as the ""Will you be the face - OR WILL YOU BE THE BOOT?"" image, which I utterly loved.</p>
 <p>Reason for all this is that a portrait of Mussolini or a swastika will get it taken down in an instant by any offended passerby, and ultimately be just a waste of paper. But something just a little ambiguous (<em>and with enough graphic appeal</em>) might stay up longer. Even your average ANTIFA only knows to look for the ADL list of ""hate symbols"", and wouldn't immediately clue in to less well known symbols (<em>or even graphics of my own design, which I have a few of</em>).</p>
 <p>I plan on distributing these around my home city (Richmond, VA), but if you're interested I'd be glad to submit some to Reaktion when I return to the US when I can do the finished illustrations.</p>",29bc2a84fb42ff3985f4ff822bd625cd,2392,217.26.255.205,0
